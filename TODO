* Make AbstractProducer implement 'Packet<O> process(Packet<I> packet)', defaulting to detecting command packets and executing them on the node as necessary followed by returning the provided packet.

* Consider transforming the 'Packet<O> process(Packet<I> packet)' method to the following signature:

    void process(Packet<I> in, Collection<Packet<O>> out)

  which would allow one or more command packets to be queued in reaction to each input packet.
