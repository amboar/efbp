* Remove the need for Command processing boilerplate -
  Abstract{Producer,Worker,Consumer} to implement

        O process(I data) throws ProcessingException;

  extracting data from the packet and calling if it's a data packet, or
  instead, executing the command.
* Implement CommandId.
* Implement IoContext concept to make it easy to schedule distinct IO jobs that
  should execute in serial order (eg, writing chunks of data to a file).
